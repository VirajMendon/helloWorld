Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.On the other hand, if you use poorly formatted filler text you may get a completely false sense of how your design will interact with real content. We propose a compromise: Only use filler text that has been edited for length and format to match the characteristics of real content as closely as possible, and use real content where possible, and where it doesn’t create too much distraction. Relax and do whatever fits with your design process. Don’t set a lot of restrictive hard-and-fast rules. Use filler text where it helps your design process, but use real content if you’ve got it, as long as it doesn’t distract and slow down your design process. Design is an evolutionary process, and filler text is just one tool in your progress-pushing arsenal. Use it where it makes sense to use it, and pull it once the natural process indicates that it’s time to roll out a descendant built with real content.
